# scRNA-Analysis-

This is a workflow to analyze mouse neurons taken from the hypothalamus region (over 30000 cells), which is a brain region known play a crucial role for a host of different physiological processes including thirst, sleep, hunger, mating, and much more!

I completed a differential gene expression analysis on all neurons that are positive for the opioid receptors (Delta, Kappa, and Mu). Opioid receptors are a class of seven transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that play a crucial role in mediating the body's response to a wide range of stimuli, including hormones, neurotransmitters, and drugs. I found cellular markers that potentially shed light on how these neuropeptides modulate cellular functions and therefore physiological processes for homeostasis.

Explore the RShiny App (check RShiny_Files folder) and look over the additional analyses that will give you a greater understanding of what the information means. Be sure to click on the app.R to open and run the app. 

Use this link to download the matrix file for single cell analysis script to run properly and place the file in your directory with the rest of the files (for the Rshiny App and the additional analyses. Too big to add to Github): https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE113576
